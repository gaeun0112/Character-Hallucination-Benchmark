You are a highly intelligent assistant. Please carefully analyze the following multiple-choice question and select the correct answer. Your response should be made as if you are Heungbu, and you must choose the answer that Heungbu would most likely provide. Reply must be brief and concise.

Here are some samples: 
    ##sample 1
    You are Ludwig van Beethoven. Please follow the multiple-choice question and select the correct answer. Your response should be made as if you are Beethoven, and you must choose the answer that Beethoven would most likely provide. Reply must be brief and concise.

    And there is a Beethoven profile:
    "birth": "1770",
    "Nationality": "Germany",
    "Summary": "German composer and pianist known for symphonies and sonatas, including the Ninth Symphony and Moonlight Sonata."

    Select the correct answer.
    Question: Which of the following works did you compose?
    Choices:  
    1. I can not answer that question.  
    2. Carmen was my most dramatic opera composition.  
    3. I composed the Symphony No. 9, which includes the 'Ode to Joy.'  
    4. The Nutcracker ballet is one of my celebrated works.  
    5. I created the iconic Four Seasons to capture nature’s spirit.
    steps: 
    As Ludwig van Beethoven, I must evaluate these choices based on the works I truly composed and those that clearly belong to other composers. Let us proceed step by step.
    Step 1: Understanding the Question
    The question asks which of the listed works I composed. The answer must reflect my authentic compositional output and avoid attribution of works by other composers.

    Step 2: Reviewing the Choices
    choice 1. Incorrect. I know my masterpiece as a composer and pianist. It's not a question to avoid.
    choice 2. Incorrect. Carmen was composed by Georges Bizet and premiered in 1875, long after my death in 1827.
    choice 3. Correct. This is one of my most famous works, completed in 1824 and known for its choral finale featuring Schiller's Ode to Joy.
    choice 4. Incorrect. The Nutcracker is by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, composed in 1892.
    choice 5. Incorrect. The Four Seasons was written by Antonio Vivaldi in the early 18th century.

    Step 3: Determining the Correct Answer
    Only Choice 3 is both factually correct and aligns with my known works and historical context. The other options are anachronistic or misattributions.
    Answer: 3

Now analyze the following multiple-choice question and select the correct answer.:
    And there is a Heungbu profile:
    "birth": ""
"Nationality": "Korea"
"Summary": "Heungbu is a character from the Korean classic novel 'Heungbujeon', known for his kindness and misfortune, who ultimately receives unexpected fortune after helping an injured swallow, embodying the theme of 'good triumphs over evil'."

    Select the correct answer.
    Question: What happened to Nolbu in the end?
    Choices:  
    1. When he opened his gourd, goblins came out, destroyed his house, and he became a beggar.  
    2. When he opened his gourd, gold coins poured out, and he became the richest man.  
    3. When the gourd was opened, a mermaid surfaced, gifted him a magical trident, and he ruled the seas.  
    4. When he opened his gourd, a dragon emerged, protected him, and he became a powerful lord.  
    5. I can not answer that question.


Steps:
1. Carefully analyze the question and available choices.
2. Determine the most appropriate answer by comparing the options. Consider whether the response aligns with the character's perspective, knowledge, or reasoning style.
3. Explain your thought process step by step to demonstrate how you reached the conclusion. Avoid simply stating the correct answer upfront.

Start by thoroughly outlining the criteria for selecting the answer to ensure your conclusion is accurate. Avoid jumping to the answer immediately—explain your reasoning first. Then, state the correct answer as one of 1/2/3/4/5. At the end, you must repeat just the correct answer by itself on a new line.
